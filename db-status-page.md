# Database Status Page

This document describes the database status page that has been added to the TextExpander Typing Game application to help diagnose database connection issues.

## Overview

The database status page is a simple HTML page that fetches and displays the response from the `/api/db-status` endpoint in a user-friendly format. It provides real-time information about the database connection status and helps troubleshoot connection issues.

## How to Access

The database status page can be accessed at:

- Production: `https://your-app-url.com/db-status.html`
- Local development: `http://localhost:8080/db-status.html`

For the specific DigitalOcean deployment mentioned in previous discussions, the URL would be:
```
https://textexpander-typing-game-pcac7.ondigitalocean.app/db-status.html
```

## Features

The database status page provides:

- Real-time status of the database connection
- Formatted display of the database status JSON response
- Explanations of what each status field means
- Troubleshooting tips for common database connection issues
- A refresh button to check the status again

## Implementation Details

### Files Added

- `public/db-status.html`: The HTML page that fetches and displays the database status

### Server Configuration

The server has been configured to serve static files from the public directory by adding the following middleware in `server/index.js`:

```javascript
// Serve static files from public directory
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../public')));
```

This ensures that the db-status.html file is accessible directly from the root URL path.

### How It Works

The page makes a fetch request to the `/api/db-status` endpoint, which checks:

1. If the application can connect to the database
2. If the database tables have been initialized
3. If the DATABASE_URL environment variable is configured

The response is then displayed in a user-friendly format with appropriate styling based on the connection status.

## Troubleshooting

If you see an error or the status is not "connected", check the following:

- Verify that the DATABASE_URL environment variable is correctly set in DigitalOcean
- Ensure that the database service is running
- Check that the SSL certificate settings are correct
- Review the application logs for more detailed error messages

## Why This Solution Works

This solution addresses the issue described in the original request by:

1. Providing a dedicated page for viewing the database status response
2. Formatting the JSON response in a readable way
3. Adding visual indicators for connection status
4. Including helpful troubleshooting information
5. Adding a refresh button for easy retesting

Unlike directly accessing the `/api/db-status` endpoint (which shows a blank page in some browsers), this page properly formats and displays the JSON response with additional context and styling.
